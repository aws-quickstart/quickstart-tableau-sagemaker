As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* Amazon API Gateway to maintain and secure a REST API with two Amazon SageMaker endpoints (GET /info and POST /evaluate).
* In the authentication group:
 - An API Gateway AWS Lambda authorizer to control access to REST API resources. When Tableau calls the REST API, API Gateway invokes the AWS Lambda authorizer to validate the caller.
 - Amazon Cognito providing a managed portal for sign-up and sign-in and a user pool to authenticate users.
* A virtual private network (VPC) configured according to AWS best practices to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the VPC:
** Two AWS Lambda functions, one attached to each SageMaker endpoint.
** VPC endpoint providing connection between your VPC and Amazon SageMaker.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
