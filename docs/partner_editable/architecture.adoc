As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A VPC configured according to AWS best practices to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* Amazon API Gateway to maintain and secure a REST API with two endpoints (info and evaluate).
* Two AWS Lambda functions, one for each API Gateway endpoint. When Tableau sends a request (for example, to retrieve a SageMaker inference) API Gateway calls the associated AWS Lambda function.
* In the Authentication group:
 - An API Gateway AWS Lambda authorizer to control access to REST API resources. When Tableau calls the REST API, API Gateway invokes the AWS Lambda authorizer to validate the caller.
 - Amazon Cognito providing a managed portal for sign-up and sign-in and a user pool to authenticate users.
