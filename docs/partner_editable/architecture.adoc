As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* Amazon API Gateway with REST API containing two endpoints (info and evaluate).
* In the authentication group:
** Amazon Cognito to provide a managed portal for sign-up and sign-in of connector users and a user pool.
** An API Gateway Lambda authorizer to connect API Gateway to the Amazon Cognito user pool for authentication.
* A VPC configured according to AWS best practices to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the VPC:
** Two AWS Lambda functions, one for each REST API endpoint (info and evaluate).
** A VPC endpoint to provide connection between the VPC and Amazon SageMaker.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
