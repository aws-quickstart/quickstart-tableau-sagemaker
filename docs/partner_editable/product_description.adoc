Customers of Tableau can use Amazon SageMaker integration to incorporate the predictions and inferences of SageMaker machine learning models in their Tableau dashboards. This Quick Start deploys a Tableau dashboard extension in the AWS Cloud to receive data from Tableau and return it after it is transformed by ML models trained and tuned with Autopilot. It removes the heavy lifting of machine learning and data science from business analysts who want to add predictive analytics to their Tableau visualizations. 

The serverless application this Quick Start deploys uses AWS best practices for security and high availability, and includes the following:

* A REST API to which Tableau can connect.
* AWS Lambda functions to facilitate connectivity between Autopilot and Tableau.
* Amazon Cognito for simple and secure user sign-in and authentication.
