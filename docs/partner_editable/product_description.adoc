This Quick Start deploys a REST API managed by Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda functions to connect Tableau and SageMaker, and Amazon Cognito for user authentication.

The deployment is designed to work with ML models trained with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot without the need for customizations. However, it supports integration of any ML models hosted by SageMaker. You're' responsible for customizing the deployment to match the Tableau Analytics Extension API and your custom-model input and output formats.
