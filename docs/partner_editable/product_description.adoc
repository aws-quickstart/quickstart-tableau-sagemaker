This Quick Start is for users who want to leverage Amazon SageMaker Autopilot machine learning (ML) models directly within their Tableau dashboards. Using AWS CloudFormation templates, it deploys a SageMaker Tableau analytic extension based on the Tableau Analytics Extension API. This allows you to include the analytics and visualization capabilities of Tableau Server in Autopilot.

The serverless application this Quick Start deploys uses AWS best practices for security and high availability, and includes the following:

* A REST API to which Tableau can connect.
* AWS Lambda functions to facilitate connectivity between Autopilot and Tableau.
* Amazon Cognito for simple and secure user sign-in and authentication.
