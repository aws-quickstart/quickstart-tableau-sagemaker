== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS

While using the {partner-product-name} it is important to follow best practices for Tableau Desktop, and Amazon SageMaker. The connector allows end users to utilize their SageMaker Machine Learning models inside of Tableau’s Table Calculations. For effective use of the connector, end users are to pass data from Tableau Table Calculations at the granularity the SageMaker model is expecting to receive (no aggregation, translation, etc).

The connector can be called from Tableau’s suite of SCRIPT_ functions (SCRIPT_REAL, SCRIPT_STR, SCRIPT_INT, SCRIPT_BOOL), available inside of Tableau’s calculated fields. The functions allow end users to pass a script along with a block of data to an external analytics engine. For the {partner-product-name}, the syntax of these calculations is as follows: Script_Function (‘[SageMaker Hosted Endpoint]’, fields in dataset to pass to model)

Notes about drafting calculations for the {partner-product-name}:

* Script Functions – the function you use in your calculated field must match the return data type of your SageMaker model.
* SageMaker Hosted Endpoint – the SageMaker model must have a hosted endpoint to use the connector.
* Fields to pass to model – you must pass from Tableau each field in the dataset, in order, that the SageMaker model is expecting.
