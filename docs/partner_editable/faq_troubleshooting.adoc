*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stackâ€™s state is retained, and you can troubleshoot the issue. 

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Ensure that you delete stack after troubleshooting.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

*Q.* How do I launch the Quick Start into AWS GovCloud (US) Regions?

*A.* While AWS GovCloud (US) Regions are not listed as link:#_supported_regions[supported Regions], this Quick Start can be deployed into a AWS GovCloud (US) Region with a few modifications to the workload template. To do this, make the following changes to the `SageMakerAPI` section of the workload template: 

* Change the `EndpointConfiguration` parameter from `EDGE` to `REGIONAL`.
* Remove `Route53:` and `HostedZoneId:`, the two lines immediately following the `EndpointConfiguration` parameter.

These changes require a modification to the deployment steps, as your certificate is deployed in the same Region as your AWS deployment to support the Regional domain configuration. 

After modifying the workload template, you can launch the Quick Start into your AWS account. After the stack is deployed, navigate to Route 53 and identify the alias record created for the custom domain (matching the output in your CloudFormation console). Manually modify this record to change it from an alias record to a CNAME record. For more information about AWS GovCloud (US) and Route 53, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-r53.html[Amazon Route 53^]. 

With these modifications, the deployment should be accessible from AWS GovCloud (US). You can test this by calling the info endpoint of your API using the custom domain name.
