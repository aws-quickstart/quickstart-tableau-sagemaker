This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot Tableau connector on the AWS Cloud. This Quick Start is for Tableau users who want to integrate predictions from Autopilot-trained machine-learning (ML) models into Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server visualizations. It deploys API endpoints shaped to transmit the protocol expected by the Tableau Analytics Extension. 

The deployment is designed to work with ML models trained with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot without the need for customizations. However, it supports integration of any ML models hosted by SageMaker. You are responsible for customizing the deployment to match the Tableau Analytics Extension and your custom-model input and output formats. For more information, see link:#_customization[Customization], later in this guide.
