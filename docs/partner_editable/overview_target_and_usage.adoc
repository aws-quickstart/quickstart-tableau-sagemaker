This Quick Start uses AWS CloudFormation to automatically deploy a serverless solution that enables Tableau users to blend predictions from Amazon SageMaker hosted models into Tableau powered visualizations. This solution works with any Tableau product supported by the https://tableau.github.io/analytics-extensions-api/docs/ae_intro.html[Tableau Analytics Extensions] API, which includes Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server.

The solution is designed to work with models trained using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot without the need for customizations. However, any machine learning (ML) models that are hosted by Amazon SageMaker Hosting Services can be integrated with Tableau through this solution. For models that are not trained using Autopilot, you are responsible for implementing transformations required to match the Tableau Analytics Extension and your custom model input and output formats.
