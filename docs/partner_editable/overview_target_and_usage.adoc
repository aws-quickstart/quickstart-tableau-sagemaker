//Avoid borrowing text from third-party websites (copying text from AWS service documentation is fine). Also, avoid marketing-speak, focusing instead on the technical aspect.

//This Quick Start uses AWS CloudFormation to automatically deploy a serverless solution that enables Tableau users to blend predictions from Amazon SageMaker-hosted models into Tableau-powered visualizations. This solution works with any Tableau product supported by the https://tableau.github.io/analytics-extensions-api/docs/ae_intro.html[Tableau Analytics Extensions] API, which includes Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server.

//The solution is designed to work with models trained using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot without the need for customizations. However, any machine-learning (ML) models hosted by Amazon SageMaker can be integrated with Tableau through this solution. For models that are not trained using Autopilot, you are responsible for implementing transformations required to match the Tableau Analytics Extension and your custom model input and output formats.

This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot Tableau connector on the AWS Cloud. This Quick Start is for Tableau users who want to integrate predictions from Amazon SageMaker-hosted machine-learning (ML) models into Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server visualizations. 

The deployment is designed to work with ML models trained with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot without the need for customizations. However, it supports integration of any ML models hosted by SageMaker. You are responsible for customizing the deployment to match the Tableau Analytics Extension API and your custom-model input and output formats. For more information, see link:#_customization[Customization], later in this guide.
