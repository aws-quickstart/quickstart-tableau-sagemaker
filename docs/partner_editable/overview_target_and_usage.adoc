With this Quick Start deployment, Tableau users can blend predictions from machine-learning (ML) models hosted by Amazon SageMaker into visualizations powered by Tableau. This deployment works with any Tableau product supported by the https://tableau.github.io/analytics-extensions-api/[Tableau Analytics Extension^], which includes Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server. 

The deployment is designed to work with ML models trained using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot without the need for customizations. However, it supports integration of any ML models hosted by SageMaker hosting services can be integrated with Tableau. For ML models not trained with Autopilot, you are responsible for implementing transformations required to match the Tableau Analytics Extension and your custom-model input and output formats.

This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides instructions for viewing and launching AWS CloudFormation templates that automate the deployment.
