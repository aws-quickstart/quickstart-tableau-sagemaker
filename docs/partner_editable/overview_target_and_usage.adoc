//This Quick Start uses AWS CloudFormation to automatically deploy a serverless solution that enables Tableau users to blend predictions from Amazon SageMaker-hosted models into Tableau-powered visualizations. This solution works with any Tableau product supported by the https://tableau.github.io/analytics-extensions-api/docs/ae_intro.html[Tableau Analytics Extensions] API, which includes Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server.

//The solution is designed to work with models trained using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot without the need for customizations. However, any machine-learning (ML) models hosted by Amazon SageMaker can be integrated with Tableau through this solution. For models that are not trained using Autopilot, you are responsible for implementing transformations required to match the Tableau Analytics Extension and your custom model input and output formats.

This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Amazon SageMaker for Tableau. This Quick Start extends your Tableau dashboard functionality so you can integrate Amazon SageMaker machine learning (ML) models in Tableau's calculated fields. The serverless application it deploys is based on Tableau's analytics extension framework. With it, you can connect SageMaker ML models to Tableau workbooks in both Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server.
