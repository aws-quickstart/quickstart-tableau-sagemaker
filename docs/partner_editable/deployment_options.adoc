# Deployment Options

This Quick Start provides three deployment option:

 - *Deploy a new solution (end-to-end deployment) into a New VPC^*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the API, Lambda Functions, Identity Provider, and other networking components. 
 - *Deploy a new solution into an existing VPC*. This option deploys the solutions resources into an existing VPC.
 - *Deploy a new solution into no VPC*. This option deploys the solutions resources into the AWS Cloud, but not in a VPC.
