This Quick Start provides three deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. Builds a new AWS environment consisting of a VPC, API, AWS Lambda functions, identity provider, and other network components.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing VPC*. Provisions resources into your existing AWS VPC.

To deploy the Quick Start into the AWS Cloud but not into a VPC, deploy the *Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing VPC* template. The set the *Launch into VPC* parameter to *No*. 

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and other settings, as discussed later in this guide.
