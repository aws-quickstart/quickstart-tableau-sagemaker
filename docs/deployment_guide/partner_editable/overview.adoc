// Fill in the info in <angle brackets> for use on the landing page only: 
This Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partner Solution deploys a REST API managed by Amazon API Gateway, lambda functions to connect Tableau and SageMaker, and Amazon Cognito for user authentication. The deployment is designed to work with ML models trained with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot without the need for customizations. However, it supports integration of any ML models hosted by SageMaker. You're responsible for customizing the deployment to match the Tableau Analytics Extension API and your custom-model input and output formats. For more information, see link:#_customization[Customization], later in this guide.

This Partner Solution reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Tableau for Amazon SageMaker. This Partner Solution extends your Tableau dashboard functionality so you can integrate Amazon SageMaker machine learning (ML) models in Tableau's calculated fields. The serverless application it deploys is based on Tableau's analytics extension framework. With it, you can connect SageMaker ML models to Tableau workbooks in both Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server.
