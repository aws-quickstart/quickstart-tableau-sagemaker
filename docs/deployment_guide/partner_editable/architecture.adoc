** An Amazon API Gateway lambda authorizer to connect API Gateway to the Amazon Cognito user pool.
* Amazon API Gateway with REST API containing endpoints (GET /info and POST /evaluate). 
* A VPC, configured according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the VPC:
** Two lambda functions, one for each REST API endpoint.
** A VPC endpoint connected to Amazon SageMaker.
