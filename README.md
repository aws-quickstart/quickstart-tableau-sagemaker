## Tableau connector with Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Lambda, and Amazon Cognito for Amazon SageMaker 

This Quick Start helps you deploy a connector environment that is based on Tableau's Analytics Extensions and includes the serverless application development framework of Amazon Serverless Application Model.

This AWS-validated architecture includes an Amazon Cognito user pool, which is an enterprise-class identity provider and authentication service. Amazon Cognito allows efficient user sign up & sign in for the connectors resources.

The Quick Start deploys a serverless stack of resources for connector capabilities. With the connector deployed on AWS, enterprises can take advantage of collaborative analytics and the price/performance economies and agility provided by the cloud while unlocking machine learning insights in their Tableau environment.

The AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start automate the following:
